  abstract  = {This paper introduces a parameter estimation method for a general class of statistical models. The method exclusively relies on the possibility to conduct simulations for the construction of interpolation-based metamodels of informative empirical characteristics and some subjectively chosen correlation structure of the underlying spatial random process. In the absence of likelihood functions for such statistical models, which is often the case in stochastic geometric modelling, the idea is to follow a quasi-likelihood (QL) approach to construct an optimal estimating function surrogate based on a set of interpolated summary statistics. Solving these estimating equations one can account for both the random errors due to simulations and the uncertainty about the meta-models. Thus, putting the QL approach to parameter estimation into a stochastic simulation setting the proposed method essentially consists of finding roots to a sequence of approximating quasiscore functions. As a simple demonstrating example, the proposed method is applied to a special parameter estimation problem of a planar Boolean model with discs. Here, the quasi-score function has a half-analytical, numerically tractable representation and allows for the comparison of the model parameter estimates found by the simulation-based method and obtained from solving the exact quasi-score equations.},

The primary focus is on estimation of a mean covariance matrix and, in particular, on the use of Procrustes size-and-shape space. Comparisons are made with other estimation techniques, including using the matrix logarithm, matrix square root and Cholesky decomposition. Applications to diffusion tensor imaging are considered and, in particular, a new measure of fractional anisotropy called Procrustes Anisotropy is discussed.},

It is assumed that function evaluations are expensive and that no additional information is available. Radial basis function interpolation is used to define a utility function. The maximizer of this function is the next point where the objective function is evaluated. We show that, for most types of radial basis functions that are considered in this paper, convergence can be achieved without further assumptions on the objective function. Besides, it turns out that our method is closely related to a statistical global optimization method, the P-algorithm. A general framework for both methods is presented. Finally, a few numerical examples show that on the set of Dixon-Szeg� test functions our method yields favourable results in comparison to other global optimization methods.},

  abstract  = {We propose an algorithm for the global optimization of expensive and noisy black box functions using a surrogate model based on radial basis functions (RBFs). A�method for RBF-based approximation is introduced in order to handle noise. New points are selected to minimize the total model uncertainty weighted against the surrogate function value. The algorithm is extended to multiple objective functions by instead weighting against the distance to the surrogate Pareto front; it therefore constitutes the first algorithm for expensive, noisy and multiobjective problems in the literature. Numerical results on analytical test functions show promise in comparison to other (commercial) algorithms, as well as results from a simulation based optimization problem.},

  abstract  = {Estimating functions provide a very general framework for statistical inference, and are particularly useful when one is either unable or unwilling to specify a likelihood function. This paper aims to provide an accessible review of estimating function theory that has potential for application to the analysis and modelling of a wide range of complex systems. Assumptions are given in terms that can be checked relatively easily in practice, and some of the more technical derivations are relegated to an online supplement for clarity of exposition. The special case of the generalized method of moments is considered in some detail. The main points are illustrated by considering the problem of inference for a class of stochastic rainfall models based on point processes, with simulations used to demonstrate the performance of the methods.},

  abstract  = {In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. These problems pose a special challenge to the field of global optimization, since existing methods often require more function evaluations than can be comfortably afforded. One way to address this challenge is to fit response surfaces to data collected by evaluating the objective and constraint functions at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization, tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response surface methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can be used to construct an efficient global optimization algorithm with a credible stopping rule. The key to using response surfaces for global optimization lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where prediction error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems which have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational obstacles can be overcome.},

Variogram estimation requires a more irregular pattern of sampling locations since comparisons must be made between measurements separated by all lags up to and beyond the range of spatial correlation. Previous studies have not considered how to combine these optimized schemes into a single survey and how to decide what proportion of sampling effort should be devoted to variogram estimation and what proportion devoted to kriging},

This method of simulated moments does not require precise estimates of these probabilities, as the law of large numbers operating across observations controls simulation error, and, hence, can use simulations of practical size. The method is useful for models such as high-dimensional multinomial probit, where computation has previously restricted applications. Statistical properties are established using empirical process methods that can handle discontinuities introduced by simulation. Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society.},

These so-called space-filling designs are now ubiquitous in corresponding publications and conferences. The statistical folklore is that such designs have superior properties when it comes to prediction and estimation of emulator functions. In this paper we want to review the circumstances under which this superiority holds, provide some new arguments and clarify the motives to go beyond space-filling. An overview over the state of the art of space-filling is introducing and complementing these results.},

The proposed Stochastic Response Surface (SRS) Method iteratively utilizes a response surface model to approximate the expensive function and identifies a promising point for function evaluation from a set of randomly generated points, called candidate points. Assuming some mild technical conditions, SRS converges to the global minimum in a probabilistic sense. We also propose Metric SRS (MSRS), which is a special case of SRS where the function evaluation point in each iteration is chosen to be the best candidate point according to two criteria: the estimated function value obtained from the response surface model, and the minimum distance from previously evaluated points. We develop a global optimization version and a multistart local optimization version of MSRS. In the numerical experiments, we used a radial basis function (RBF) model for MSRS and the resulting algorithms, Global MSRBF and Multistart Local MSRBF, were compared to 6 alternative global optimization methods, including a multistart derivative-based local optimization method. Multiple trials of all algorithms were compared on 17 multimodal test problems and on a 12-dimensional groundwater bioremediation application involving partial differential equations. The results indicate that Multistart Local MSRBF is the best on most of the higher dimensional problems, including the groundwater problem. It is also at least as good as the other algorithms on most of the lower dimensional problems. Global MSRBF is competitive with the other alternatives on most of the lower dimensional test problems and also on the groundwater problem. These results suggest that MSRBF is a promising approach for the global optimization of expensive functions.

  abstract  = {We present a new strategy for the constrained global optimization of expensive black box functions using response surface models. A response surface model is simply a multivariate approximation of a continuous black box function which is used as a surrogate model for optimization in situations where function evaluations are computationally expensive. Prior global optimization methods that utilize response surface models were limited to box-constrained problems, but the new method can easily incorporate general nonlinear constraints. In the proposed method, which we refer to as the Constrained Optimization using Response Surfaces (CORS) Method, the next point for costly function evaluation is chosen to be the one that minimizes the current response surface model subject to the given constraints and to additional constraints that the point be of some distance from previously evaluated points. The distance requirement is allowed to cycle, starting from a high value (global search) and ending with a low value (local search). The purpose of the constraint is to drive the method towards unexplored regions of the domain and to prevent the premature convergence of the method to some point which may not even be a local minimizer of the black box function. The new method can be shown to converge to the global minimizer of any continuous function on a compact set regardless of the response surface model that is used. Finally, we considered two particular implementations of the CORS method which utilize a radial basis function model (CORS-RBF) and applied it on the box-constrained Dixon--Szeg{\"o} test functions and on a simple nonlinearly constrained test function. The results indicate that the CORS-RBF algorithms are competitive with existing global optimization algorithms for costly functions on the box-constrained test problems. The results also show that the CORS-RBF algorithms are better than other algorithms for constrained global optimization on the nonlinearly constrained test problem.},

  abstract      = {Whenever simulation requires much computer time, interpolation is needed. Simulationists use different interpolation techniques (eg linear regression), but this paper focuses on Kriging. This technique was originally developed in geostatistics by DG Krige, and has recently been widely applied in deterministic simulation. This paper, however, focuses on random or stochastic simulation. Essentially, Kriging gives more weight to 'neighbouring' observations. There are several types of Kriging; this paper discusses-besides Ordinary Kriging-a novel type, which 'detrends' data through the use of linear regression. Results are presented for two examples of input/output behaviour of the underlying random simulation model: Ordinary and Detrended Kriging give quite acceptable predictions; traditional linear regression gives the worst results.},

  abstract      = {A wide variety of uncertainty propagation methods exist in literature; however, there is a lack of good understanding of their relative merits. In this paper, a comparative study on the performances of several representative uncertainty propagation methods, including a few newly developed methods that have received growing attention, is performed. The full factorial numerical integration, the univariate dimension reduction method, and the polynomial chaos expansion method are implemented and applied to several test problems. They are tested under different settings of the performance nonlinearity, distribution types of input random variables, and the magnitude of input uncertainty. The performances of those methods are compared in moment estimation, tail probability calculation, and the probability density function construction, corresponding to a wide variety of scenarios of design under uncertainty, such as robust design, and reliability-based design optimization. The insights gained are expected to direct designers for choosing the most applicable uncertainty propagation technique in design under uncertainty.},

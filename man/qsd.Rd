A statistical model of random numbers
}
\details{
This is a pedagogic example of a simulated data set for quasi-likelihood estimation using
normally distributed random numbers. The model outcome is a vector of summary statistics, that is,
simply the median and mean average deviation of \code{n=10} random numbers, which is evaluated at the
model parameter \eqn{\theta=(\mu,\sigma)} with mean \eqn{\mu} and standard deviation \eqn{\sigma} as
the parameters of the normal distribution. We estimate the model parameter given a specific
"observation" of those summary statistics. Clearly, maximum likelihood estimation would be the 
method of first choice if we had a real sample of observations. However, this example is used to demonstrate
the basic workflow of estimating the model parameter. We use this model as a standard example in the package
documentation.
